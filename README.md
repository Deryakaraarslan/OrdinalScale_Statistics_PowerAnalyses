# OrdinalScale_Statistics_PowerAnalyses

Currently under development

The pipeline allows statistical analyses of ordinal scale data, compares distributions of measuremnts in control groups to test samples. 'polr' and 'emmeans' packages are used for these purposes. Furthermore, the distributions are utilized to derive simulation based power analyses. Hence, the functionalities are:
- The users can import experimental results that are based on ordinal scale measurements, 
- Produce spine plots from their data and obtain statistical descriptions (effect sizes, significance values etc)
- Collect curve graphs for power analyses
- Obtain minimum amount of samples needed to achieve user specified power levels
